## SAS program to create synthetic eHARS data set

The success of Ending the HIV Epidemic: A Plan for America or (EHE) will depend on innovative, targeted, population specific interventions. Achieving early and sustained viral suppression following diagnosis of HIV infection is critical to improving outcomes for persons living with HIV and reducing transmission.  A deeper understanding of the socio-contextual factors driving geographic variability of VS can also guide the development of evidence-informed public health approaches to achieve timely individual and population viral control. This simulation is designed to randomly create realistic geographic components that could exist in eHARS data for each state, while accounting for the variability in this data that occurs over time. The simulated data created in the program can allow for researchers to troubleshoot development of analytic methods, while reducing the time needed from their public health department partners.
